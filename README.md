## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./design/screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I would like to add some functionality with JavaScript in the future, as well as using a framework to help build future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This resource definitely helped me out a lot with figuring out flexbox. This website is an industry standard when it comes to help within the dev community.
